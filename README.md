### Core Product Features:

Intelligent AI Cards: Instead of dry definitions, it uses Gemini to generate fun, natural definitions and casual "Usage Notes" that explain cultural nuances and slang like a knowledgeable friend.

Visual Concept Generation: For every word searched, the app uses AI to generate a custom pop-art style illustration, helping users create strong mental associations with the term.

Contextual Storytelling: A unique "Story Mode" allows users to take a handful of words from their personal notebook and have the AI weave them into a funny, memorable short story.

### Interactive Study Suite:

Notebook: A personalized list of words users want to master.

Study Mode: A dedicated flashcard interface with a "flip-to-reveal" mechanism for active recall.

Natural Pronunciation: High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) for both the main terms and example sentences.

Social & Collaborative: Integrated sharing via the Web Share API, allowing users to send term cards (including definitions and images) to friends or social media.
